This application display's information regarding the number of corona cases that have been reported across the globe similar to a Covid-19 dashboard.
## Description
It is an extracurricular project made while learning how java applications work by using different technologies.The project helped me in learning how classes and objects can be used to create a entities,create services to fetch data from a source and making the required changes before displaying it on the user-interface. The project also showcases the power of frameworks such as Spring-boot which can make application development less hectic and Bootstrap which helped in building the user-interface.
